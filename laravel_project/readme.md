## About Solar Domination

I was given a course assignment to create an online game, the theme and the gameplay weren't specified ,so I thought of a space game and went with it. Solar Domination is an online space strategy game. After the registration the user has his own planet and orbital station. The planet has 3 buildings that provide resources and the orbital station has it's own Shipyard. With the resources from the planet the user can upgrade the buildings , create ships and evolve. He can find all other users , scan their planets and if he wants he can send his fleet and attack them. The goal is just to have fun playing it. For more info of the game you can check it out : [Solar Domination](http://www.marekradkov.com/solardomination/public/).

Technologies used for the game:

- PHP 7 with Laravel 5.3
- JavaScript with jQuery
- HTML 5
- CSS 3 + Bootstrap
